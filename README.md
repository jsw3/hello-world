About me

I am a novice web developer with a background in academic research. I picked up coding during the course of my research, becoming interested in natural language processing and web design. I'm using my repositories to share some basic scripts and programs I've written for academic purposes. These relate to teaching Shakespeare in an academic setting but I hope they will be useful to anyone interested in digital humanities and natural language processing more generally.
